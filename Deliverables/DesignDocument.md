# Instructions

The design must satisfy the Official Requirements document, notably functional and non functional requirements

# High level design 

<discuss architectural styles used, if any>
<report package diagram>
```plantuml
package frontend{

    package it.polito.ezshop.controller 
    package it.polito.ezshop.GUI
    }
package backend{
    package it.polito.ezshop.exceptions
    package it.polito.ezshop.model
    package it.polito.ezshop.data
    package it.polito.ezshop.back.controller
}


/'it.polito.ezshop.GUI --> it.polito.ezshop.model'/ 
/'it.polito.ezshop.controller --> it.polito.ezshop.model'/ 
it.polito.ezshop.exceptions --> it.polito.ezshop.data
it.polito.ezshop.model --> it.polito.ezshop.data
it.polito.ezshop.back.controller --> it.polito.ezshop.model
/'it.polito.ezshop.model --> it.polito.ezshop.data'/
```





# Low level design

<for each package, report class diagram>









# Verification traceability matrix

\<for each functional requirement from the requirement document, list which classes concur to implement it>











# Verification sequence diagrams 
\<select key scenarios from the requirement document. For each of them define a sequence diagram showing that the scenario can be implemented by the classes and methods in the design>
