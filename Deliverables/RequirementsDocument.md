# Essential description

Small shops require a simple application to support the owner or manager. A small shop (ex a food shop) occupies 50-200 square meters, sells 500-2000 different item types, has one or a few cash registers 
EZShop is a software application to:
* manage sales
* manage inventory
* manage customers
* support accounting


# Stakeholders


| Stakeholder name  | Description | 
| ----------------- |:-----------:|
|	Customer  ||
|	Registered Customer  ||
|	Shop's Owner  ||
|	Suppliers  ||
|	POS System  ||
|	Inventory Item  ||
|	Cashier ||
|	Accountant  ||
|	Warehouse Worker  ||
|	Inventory Manager  ||


# Context Diagram and interfaces

## Context Diagram
\<Define here Context diagram using UML use case diagram>

\<actors are a subset of stakeholders>

## Interfaces
\<describe here each interface in the context diagram>

\<GUIs will be described graphically in a separate document>

| Actor | Logical Interface | Physical Interface  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
|   Actor x..     |  |  |

# Stories and personas
\<A Persona is a realistic impersonation of an actor. Define here a few personas and describe in plain text how a persona interacts with the system>

\<Persona is-an-instance-of actor>

\<stories will be formalized later as scenarios in use cases>

Paul is 38 and just opened a new flower shop, he has some experience in business but not many resources to hire many workers. He spends many hours managing the inventory and the finances of his small shop. He thinks that he could better spend his time interacting with clients and taking care of the flowers.

Martina is 30 and works in an office all day. She wants to do shopping before going home, in his favorite food shop, once a week. She is very practical with computers and smartphones but doesn't want to dedicate too much time ordering online. 

Calogero is 29, he has been a cashier in a supermarket for the last 5 years. Being a cashier he has to deal with customers who want to receive a prize in exchange for their fidelity card points. In order to do so, every time a client asks for a certain item he should call an inventory worker to get the list of available items and eventually update it.

Giorgio is 23, he likes to play video games, for this reason often he goes to his favorite videogames shop and buys a lot of things. He would appreciate being rewarded for all his purchases.


# Functional and non functional requirements

## Functional Requirements

\<In the form DO SOMETHING, or VERB NOUN, describe high level capabilities of the system>

\<they match to high level use cases>

| ID        | Description  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
|  FR1     |  |
|  FR2     |   |
| FRx..  | | 

## Non Functional Requirements

\<Describe constraints on functional requirements>

| ID        | Type (efficiency, reliability, ..)           | Description  | Refers to |
| ------------- |:-------------:| :-----:| -----:|
|  NFR1     |   |  | |
|  NFR2     | |  | |
|  NFR3     | | | |
| NFRx .. | | | | 


# Use case diagram and use cases


## Use case diagram
\<define here UML Use case diagram UCD summarizing all use cases, and their relationships>


\<next describe here each use case in the UCD>
### Use case 1, UC1
| Actors Involved        |  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
|  Precondition     | \<Boolean expression, must evaluate to true before the UC can start> |  
|  Post condition     | \<Boolean expression, must evaluate to true after UC is finished> |
|  Nominal Scenario     | \<Textual description of actions executed by the UC> |
|  Variants     | \<other executions, ex in case of errors> |

##### Scenario 1.1 

\<describe here scenarios instances of UC1>

\<a scenario is a sequence of steps that corresponds to a particular execution of one use case>

\<a scenario is a more formal description of a story>

\<only relevant scenarios should be described>

| Scenario 1.1 | |
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
|  Precondition     | \<Boolean expression, must evaluate to true before the scenario can start> |
|  Post condition     | \<Boolean expression, must evaluate to true after scenario is finished> |
| Step#        | Description  |
|  1     |  |  
|  2     |  |
|  ...     |  |

##### Scenario 1.2

##### Scenario 1.x

### Use case 2, UC2
..

### Use case x, UCx
..



# Glossary

\<use UML class diagram to define important terms, or concepts in the domain of the system, and their relationships> 

\<concepts are used consistently all over the document, ex in use cases, requirements etc>

# System Design
\<describe here system design>

\<must be consistent with Context diagram>

# Deployment Diagram 

\<describe here deployment diagram >
